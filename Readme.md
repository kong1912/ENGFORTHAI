# Web app for pronunciation training by using automatic speech recognition technology and intelligent tutoring system

A number of English learning materials are developed for online learning and self-learning  applications by applying Information Communication Technology (ICT). Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is favorably chosen as a learning technology used for English pronunciation practice. 

This project aims to build an algorithm with ASR for a web application to practice English pronunciation, as self-learning material. To create the web application, 
Flask is used for creating the architecture and features of the webapplication. 

The architecture algorithm is coded by using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), an end-to-end algorithm, to be the algorithm for deep learning. The deep learning algorithm automatically maps audio and text files, and then transfers into the speech recognition models, as the application programming interface 
used in the web application. 

The ASR used in the web application consists of two datasets of audio files for English pronunciation practice. One dataset is English Native Accent ASR, which is the audio library with the standard American English native accent or IPA pronunciation. The other is Thai-English Accent ASR, which is the audio library produced by Thai people with different knowledge and experiences in English speaking communication. 

These two datasets of ASR are designed for learning and assessment tools of English pronunciation practice. The practice of English pronunciation particularly focuses on eleven problematic consonant sounds of Thai EFL students, according to the previous studies of English pronunciation in Thai contexts. These eleven consonant sounds are divided into five lessons: 1) /ð/-/θ/-/tθ/, 2) /ʒ/-/ʃ/, 3) /dʒ/-/tʃ/, 4) /z/-/s/ and 5) /b/-/p/. 

The application users are required to take tests before and after the lessons whereas these two datasets of ASR are applied to estimate the user’s English pronunciation ability. If the users receive a score higher than 90%, between 61-90%, between 31-60%, and lower than 30%, they will be classified as an EFL learner with an American English accent, a native-like accent, an intelligible Thai-English accent, a localized Thai-English accent, respectively. The web application will be completely developed and then examined in order to test its full functions and effectiveness.
